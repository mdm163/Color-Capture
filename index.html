<!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Elevator Pitch Generator web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000 year old formula to help you pitch an idea, explaining who you are and what you want, why it's important, and what it will do for your audience. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about rhetoric, and a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that helps pitch your idea and learn a little bit about coding. 

You could make web presentations the easy way by creating a pdf's or powerpoint, or you could do a little more work to better understand these digital tools that you use everyday to (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand our tools and how they work. 

In this file, you will work through the four questions of stasis: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. This method is tried and true, 100% guaranteed to help you say something meaningful about almost anything. While the Greeks originally used it to help them explore questions and issues, and to try to figure out where others might disagree on those issues, the design can easily be adapted to other ends like this one. You should even commit this exercise of stasis to memory. That way, if you are ever stuck on an elevator with someone important...you'll be ready to have something to say. That was indeed the problem for Archimedes, the engineer who built the first elevator in 236BC and afterwards found himself riding in his elevator with all kinds of powerful people, ascending and descending with nothing to say. And for almost two hundred years, the the problem continued to plague the Greeks until the rhetorician Hermagoras solved this communication problem by developing the questions of stasis. Some say it was actually Aristotle, some hundred years pre-elevator, who first theorized the questions of stasis. And much later in the Roman period, Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes added their own iterations.   

I like to think about stasis theory in terms of space. Some say the goal of this exercise is stasis, or agreement with the other, but I would argue that the goal of stasis is actually movement. Yes, when we come to stasis, we stop. But we stop only long enough in time/space to assess how we got where we are and what happened before moving forward. I argue that we actually use stasis theory to ready ourselves and others to move with changed velocity (in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed.) 
    
To get started with the Elevator Pitch Generator, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our stasis theory web document.
    
If you are working in groups on GitHub, one group member will need to fork the website in GitHub and then each group members should fork from this new repository.

BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

  <h1>Definition</h1>

    <h2>Color Capture is a simple python program displayed online using an HTML file. The application analyzes the indiviudal pixels of an image and determines the overall percentages of the major colors (red, green, blue, black, and white) present in the image. It has a simple layout that is easy to understand. Currently, the application can only analyze pre-embedded images to show proof of concept; however, future versions will incorporate the option for the user to upload their own images and have them be ranked in color order. A GitHub repository with a README, instructions, and license has been created for future development of the project.</h2>

    <!--Replace the image here. You can also control image width and height %.-->
    
 <img src="collage3.jpeg" alt="descibe image here for accessibility issues" class="center-small-image" style="width:50%;height:50%;">

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Quality</h1>
     <h2>While this problem isn't on a similar scale to that of climate change, it still is important. There are currently no online applications that provide this type of color gradient analysis. This means that without this application, people would have to organize their photos by hand. When I first moved into my apartment this semester, I attempted to create a collage organized by color gradient. However, it proved to be rather challenging and took days to get it to look somewhat decent (see image above for result). Having an application that automatically analyzes and organizes photos based on color would have saved me much time and aggravation; I believe that creating this application will greatly benefit many in the artistic community.</h2>

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>
        Moving forward, Color Capture will transform from a proof of concept to a fully fledged application. First, users will be able to upload their own images to determine color makeup and rank them by color order. Second, users will be able to create accounts and login to access past projects. Third and finally, additional collaging techniques will be incorporated into the website for further applicational use. 3 version updates would be required to accomplish the tasks above. I beleive that implementing the first version update would be the most important step for future use.</h2>

<!--Looking to add componets. You have come to the right place. See below.>

***Add an image. 
To add an image, all you need to do is add the HTML, the CSS style has aleady been set. Just drop the following code between other <div></div> elements...and you will need to replace the stinky feet.jpg. 

***Small image: 

<div>
<img src="feet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center-small-image" alt="my feet in water" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
</div>

***Large image:   

<div>
<img src="feet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center-large-image" alt="my feet in water" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
</div>

***Add a photo grid:

    <div class="row"> 
  <div class="column">
    <img src="pgrid1.jpg" alt= decribe the image HERE for accessibility purposes>
    <img src="pgrid2.jpg" alt= decribe the image HERE for accessibility purposes>
        </div>
<div class="column">
    <img src="pgrid3.jpg" alt= decribe the image HERE for accessibility purposes>
    <img src="pgrid4.jpg" alt= decribe the image HERE for accessibility purposes>
        </div>
<div class="column">
