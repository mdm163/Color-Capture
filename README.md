# Color-Capture
Color Capture is an HTML application that can analyze the color makeup of an image. Currently, it only exists as a proof of concept; however, future versions will allow users to upload their own images and create accounts. I also envision the incorporate machine learning to expand the current color base (red, green, blue, black, and white). This application is perfect for collaging and various other artistic endeavours. 

# Detailed below is the version history of Color Capture:
- Version 1.0: This version is the beta version of the application. It existed as a python file with no UI with limited output.
- Version 1.1 (current): This version is a html file that utilizes html and javascript. It has limited UI with displaying the test image and the corresponding color breakdown
- Version 1.2 (future phase 1): This version will be an html file that allows users to upload their own images to be analyzed. It will still have limited UI, but will get across what the user needs to know.
- Version 1.3 (future phase 2): This version will be an html website with a fully functional user accounts.
- Version 1.4 (future phase 3): This version will begin to incorporate machine learning that allows the application to learn more colors over time as more and more pictures are analyzed.

# Q & A:
### 1. How do you use the current version of Color Capture?
To use Color Capture you must download ColorCapture.html and the american flag image. Then you must open ColorCapture.html in Firefox as other web browsers such as Chrome and Safari have different ways of storing files and will not allow the program to work properly. Finally, the document will load and it will show the breakdown of the colors in the american flag.

### 2. How will users be able to upload their own images?
There will be an upload button that prompts users for an image name. Color Capture will then analyze the provided image and return the results.

### 3. How will accounts work?
Color Capture will utilize FLASK to create a dynamic web application that includes the option for users to create accounts, login, and logout. Having accounts will allow users to login and view previous image projects and various other tools. Future versions will also add other collaging tools. 

### 4. How do you envision machine learning will be incorporated?
Color Capture only analyzes the main RGB colors as well as black and white. I believe that machine learning will help the application expand the current color base. For example, when deciding whether a color between red and orange should be counted as red or orange, having a machine learning algorithm would greatly improve the applications accuracy in determing which color it should be. Also, this will allow more specific colors, such as Chartreuse, to be learned and stored for future occurences.

# Uses:
* As noted above, ColorCapture can only be run in FireFox currently. Trying to run the html file in any other web browsers will result in the program not running correctly.
